Dump.tools Chrome extension, v 0.1Beta
======================================
textchimp@gmail.com (c) 2012 

(Tested only on Chromium 18.0.1025.151 (Developer Build 130497) Ubuntu 10.04)


Keyboard bindings:
------------------

TAB: show/hide preview panel
ESC: close preview window (also close Favourites panel if open, close Search results if Open)
  `: show/hide Favourites panel

Mouse bindings:
---------------

left-click:       copy image to preview panel (i.e., no longer favs)
ctrl-left-click:  Fav
shift-left-click: copy image to permanent favourites


Right click on any image in any tab and select 'Dump it!' to copy image URL to text 
input/preview panel.



Issues:
-------

* Images in preview window are top-aligned rather than bottom aligned, and probably
  not shown in proportion relative to each other... hopefully just a bit of CSS 
  tweaking needed here

* Any text (not image URLs) typed in main text input always shows on the right of all
  images in the preview panel, no matter where it's actually typed relative to the
  URLS... more CSS float tweaking

* Current maximum of 5Mb storage for chrome extensions limits number of permanent
  favourites, as thumbnails are stored using DataURLs

* The layout in the permanent favourites popup is a bit messy and chaotic, needs a 
  cleanup. Also no way currently to delete items from the favourites, and (though
  there is a structure for tags in the localStorage data) no way to limit popup
  contents by tags. The popup will also get progressively slower to load as more
  favourites are added, even though the thubnails are locally cached...
